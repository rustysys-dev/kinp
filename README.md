# kinp
use kind with podman

## Installation

```bash
sudo bash install
```

## Usage

Can be used exactly like kind, because it is kind.

Exporting the `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` environmental variable with your aws account id
will generate an authentication file for kind nodes to use when building a
cluster if one doesn't already exist.
